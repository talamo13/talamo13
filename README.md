### About Me  
Hey there! I'm **Tyler Alamo-Covert**, a software engineer and Computer Science student at CSULB. I enjoy building innovative projects, especially in AI, backend development, and system-level programming.  

I've worked on a variety of projects, including:  
🚀 **NASA Artemis Mission** – Developed software for Lunar Rovers, contributing to autonomous navigation and mission-critical systems.  
🧠 **Machine Learning Lab at CSULB** – Worked on AI-driven applications, focusing on model training, optimization, and deployment.  
🔐 **Department of Defense** – Designed and implemented secure software solutions, emphasizing high-performance and reliability.  

I mainly work with **Python, C++, and Java**, and I’m always exploring new technologies to build efficient and scalable systems.  

Always open to new challenges and collaborations—let’s build something cool! 🚀
